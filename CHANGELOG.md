The minor version will be incremented upon a breaking change and the patch version will be incremented for features.

## [Unreleased]

## [14.3.0]

- Improved leader schedule and slot tracking by using `FirstShredReceived` events, resulting in 350-400ms faster TPU routing.
- Refactored `grpc_geyser.rs `for better code clarity and testability.
- Separated slot updates and block metadata into distinct types and channels for improved performance and maintainability.
- Added `SlotStatus` enum to better represent slot states.
- Internal: Renamed config `primary_grpc` and `secondary_grpc` to a single `grpc` field. `primary_grpc` is still supported for backward compatibility.
- Minor internal renames and refactoring to clarify slot/block handling.
- No breaking changes to public APIs.

## [14.2.0]

- Introduce connection prediction in quic-gateway to proactively identify potential leaders before forwarding transaction demands

## [14.1.0]

- Moved away from solana-sdk for individuals solana crates instead.

## [14.0.0]

- Update `yellowstone-shield-store` to `0.5.1` which adjusts public API of `PolicyStore`.

## [13.0.0]

- Removed `ConnectionCache` to use `QuicGateway` that maximise each QUIC connection streaming capability instead of opening new connections.
- Remove retry logic when `relay_mode` is set to `true`.
- Removed `quic.rs` and `quic_solana` modules.
- Refactored `transactions.rs` with simpler retry logic and sending logic.
- Switched to Jemalloc for Global memory allocator

## [12.0.1]

- Updated to Cargo edition 2024 and 1.85 toolchain.

## [12.0.0]

### Breaking Changes

- Remove `shield.enabled` configuration in favor enabling through Jet feature `yellowstone_shield`.

### Features

- Added `YELLOWSTONE_SHIELD` feature flag in proto file definition

## [11.2.0]

### Features

- Added support for Yellowstone Shield transaction filtering. When enabled via `shield.enabled`, applies access control policies to determine which transactions can be forwarded to leader nodes.
- Changed `RpcSendTransactionConfigWithBlocklist` to `JetRpcSendTransactionConfig` and renamed all related fields from `blocklist` to `forwarding_policies`
- Updated protocol buffer definition field from `repeated string blocklist_pdas = 4` to `repeated string forwarding_policies = 4` for consistency
- Added support for base58-encoded public keys in `forwarding_policies` field with automatic validation and filtering of invalid keys
- Made `forwarding_policies` optional with a default empty vector when not specified in JSON RPC requests

## [11.1.3]

### Features

- Version added to metadata to jet-gateway using subscribe request.
- Added support for pushing metrics to vmAgent.

## [11.1.2]

### Fixes

- Added stake-based max_streams formula when creating QUIC connection in `QuicPool` so max stream per connection is derived from current stake weight.

### Fixes

- Added missing `LEADER_MTU` metrics registration
- Added missing `LEADER_RTT` metrics registration
